\subsubsection{What is MapReduce}

MapReduce is a yarn-based system commonly used for processing massive dataset:

\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{-}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Performs concurrent processing by dividing the dataset into multiple chunks on the Hadoop commodity servers.
    \item Instead of sending the data to the machine with the logic to execute, we send the logic to the data to execute, specifically, the server.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{How MapReduce works}

As the name suggests, it is executed in the order that is Map first, Reduce later:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{Step \arabic*.}]
    \item \textbf{Split:} Splitting the dataset into multiple data batches.
    \item \textbf{Map:} Mapping every element within each data batch to a $<key,value>$ pair.
    \item \textbf{Await Completion:} Wait for all data batches to finish mapping the pairs.
    \item \textbf{Combine:} Combine the $<key,value>$ pairs in the form of a list (e.g., [[A,1],[A,1]])
    \item \textbf{Partition:}
\end{enumerate}
