\textbf{Abstract:}\\
This project implements the PCY algorithm to identify frequent itemsets
and generate association rules from transactional data. Using PySpark
for distributed processing, the algorithm applies a two-pass method: the
first pass counts individual items, and the second pass counts item
pairs while pruning infrequent pairs with hash buckets. Results include
frequent itemsets, pairs, and association rules based on support and
confidence thresholds. The implementation follows object-oriented
principles for scalability and efficiency.

\textbf{1. Introduction}

Frequent itemset mining is essential for discovering item associations
in transactional data, such as market basket analysis. The PCY algorithm
improves efficiency by using hash buckets to reduce the computational
cost of finding frequent item pairs. This project applies the PCY
algorithm to mine frequent itemsets and generate association rules based
on support and confidence thresholds, using PySpark for scalable data
processing.

\textbf{2. Approach}

The PCY algorithm is based on two key passes through the data. In the
first pass, frequent individual items are identified and counted. In the
second pass, frequent item pairs are counted, and hash buckets are used
to prune less frequent pairs. The hash function maps item pairs to
buckets, and only pairs that have a sufficient bucket count are
considered frequent. This approach significantly reduces the number of
pair comparisons and improves algorithm efficiency.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Step 1:} Count individual items using the support threshold.
\item
  \textbf{Step 2:} Count pairs of frequent items and hash them into
  buckets.
\item
  \textbf{Step 3:} Prune item pairs that are not frequent based on the
  bucket counts.
\item
  \textbf{Step 4:} Generate association rules using the confidence
  threshold.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{3. Implementation Details}

\textbf{3.1. Data Loading and Preprocessing}

Data is loaded using PySpark's read.csv function. Each transaction is
represented as a basket, and the data is grouped by customer and date.
The collect\_set function is used to create a list of items bought
together in each transaction.

\textbf{3.2. First Pass: Counting Frequent Items}

In the first pass, each item's frequency is counted, and only those
items that meet the support threshold are considered frequent. The item
counts are stored in a dictionary, sorted in descending order.

\textbf{3.3. Second Pass: Counting Frequent Pairs}

During the second pass, the algorithm generates pairs from frequent
items and counts their occurrences. Hashing is applied to map pairs into
buckets, and the bucket counts are used to prune pairs that do not meet
the minimum support threshold.

\textbf{3.4. Association Rule Generation}

For each frequent pair, confidence is calculated as the ratio of the
pair's count to the individual item count. Association rules are
generated if the confidence meets the given threshold. The rules are
sorted by confidence.

\textbf{4. Experimental Results}

The PCY algorithm was executed on a transactional dataset of retail
transactions, where each transaction (basket) represented a set of items
purchased by a customer. The algorithm was applied with the following
parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Support threshold:} 2 (minimum count for items to be
  considered frequent).
\item
  \textbf{Confidence threshold:} 0.5 (minimum confidence for association
  rules).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{4.1. Frequent Items}

The first pass of the algorithm counted the occurrence of each
individual item in the transactions. The following are the top 30
frequent items identified based on the support threshold:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 2\tabcolsep) * \real{0.7205}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 2\tabcolsep) * \real{0.2795}}@{}}
\toprule()
\begin{minipage}[b]{\linewidth}\raggedright
\textbf{Item}
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[b]{\linewidth}\raggedright
\textbf{Count}
\end{minipage} \\
\midrule()
\endhead
Whole milk & 2363 \\
Other vegetables & 1827 \\
Rolls/buns & 1646 \\
Soda & 1453 \\
Yogurt & 1285 \\
Root vegetables & 1041 \\
Tropical fruit & 1014 \\
Bottled water & 908 \\
Sausage & 903 \\
Citrus fruit & 795 \\
Pastry & 774 \\
Pip fruit & 734 \\
... & ... \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

\textbf{4.2. Frequent Item Pairs}

In the second pass, the algorithm counted pairs of frequent items across
all transactions. The top 30 frequent item pairs, sorted by frequency,
are as follows:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 2\tabcolsep) * \real{0.8307}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 2\tabcolsep) * \real{0.1693}}@{}}
\toprule()
\begin{minipage}[b]{\linewidth}\raggedright
\textbf{Pair}
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[b]{\linewidth}\raggedright
\textbf{Count}
\end{minipage} \\
\midrule()
\endhead

(\textquotesingle Whole milk\textquotesingle,
\textquotesingle Rolls/buns\textquotesingle) & 209 \\
(\textquotesingle Whole milk\textquotesingle,
\textquotesingle Soda\textquotesingle) & 174 \\
(\textquotesingle Whole milk\textquotesingle,
\textquotesingle Yogurt\textquotesingle) & 167 \\
(\textquotesingle Rolls/buns\textquotesingle, \textquotesingle Other

vegetables\textquotesingle) & 145 \\
(\textquotesingle Whole milk\textquotesingle,
\textquotesingle Sausage\textquotesingle) & 134 \\
(\textquotesingle Whole milk\textquotesingle, \textquotesingle Tropical
fruit\textquotesingle) & 123 \\
(\textquotesingle Yogurt\textquotesingle, \textquotesingle Other
vegetables\textquotesingle) & 121 \\
(\textquotesingle Rolls/buns\textquotesingle,
\textquotesingle Soda\textquotesingle) & 121 \\
(\textquotesingle Yogurt\textquotesingle,
\textquotesingle Rolls/buns\textquotesingle) & 117 \\
(\textquotesingle Whole milk\textquotesingle, \textquotesingle Root
vegetables\textquotesingle) & 113 \\
... & ... \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

\textbf{4.3. Association Rules}

Once frequent item pairs were identified, association rules were
generated based on the confidence threshold of 0.5. The confidence for
each rule was computed by dividing the pair count by the count of the
antecedent item. The top 30 association rules, sorted by confidence, are
presented below:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 2\tabcolsep) * \real{0.7257}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 2\tabcolsep) * \real{0.2743}}@{}}
\toprule()
\begin{minipage}[b]{\linewidth}\raggedright
\textbf{Rule}
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[b]{\linewidth}\raggedright
\textbf{Confidence}
\end{minipage} \\
\midrule()
\endhead
Preservation products → Soups & 1.00 \\
Kitchen utensil → Pasta & 1.00 \\
Kitchen utensil → Bottled water & 1.00 \\
Kitchen utensil → Rolls/buns & 1.00 \\
Bags → Yogurt & 0.50 \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

These association rules represent the likelihood that certain items in
the antecedent (left-hand side) will lead to the items in the consequent
(right-hand side). For example, the rule "Preservation products → Soups"
has a confidence of 1.00, meaning whenever preservation products are
bought, soups are always purchased as well.

\textbf{4.4. Performance Evaluation}

The PCY algorithm effectively identified frequent items, pairs, and
association rules with reasonable execution time and memory usage. Given
the dataset size, the distributed nature of Spark ensured that the
computation was scalable.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Time Complexity:} The use of hashing significantly reduces the
  complexity of item pair generation, making the PCY algorithm faster
  than traditional algorithms such as the Apriori algorithm.
\item
  \textbf{Memory Usage:} Memory usage was managed well by leveraging the
  distributed processing capabilities of Spark.
\end{itemize}

algorithm efficiently identified frequent items and pairs, and generated
association rules based on the given support and confidence thresholds.
The use of hash buckets in the second pass helped prune non-frequent
item pairs, improving performance. The implementation was carried out in
an object-oriented manner to support scalability and maintainability.
Further optimizations, such as parallelizing certain steps and
optimizing memory usage, could enhance performance for larger datasets.
