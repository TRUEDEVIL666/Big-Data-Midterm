    \section{Introduction}
    \label{sec:introduction}

    The project consists of three distinct tasks that cover different aspects in mining large datasets.
    The first task involves the practice of running a MapReduce program in Java and implementation of the A-Priori algorithm with the data given by the lecturer.
    The second task entails the implementation of the PCY algorithm OOP form to identify frequent pairs and generate relevant information.
    The last task involves the student conducting implementation of the MinHashLSH algorithm and a manual method of calculating the Jaccard distance to identify similar pairs of dates defined in the requirement, as well as make comparison where needed.

    \section*{Acknowledgment}

    The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without an ``e'' after the ``g''.
    Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. G.) thanks $\ldots$''.
    Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''.
    Put sponsor acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

    \section*{References}

    Please number citations consecutively within brackets~\cite{b1}.
    The sentence punctuation follows the bracket~\cite{b2}.
    Refer simply to the reference number, as in~\cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference~\cite{b3}'' except at the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference~\cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

    Number footnotes separately in superscripts.
    Place the actual footnote at
    the bottom of the column in which it was cited.
    Do not put footnotes in the abstract or reference list.
    Use letters for table footnotes.

    Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use ``et al.''.
    Papers that have not been published, even if they have been submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished''~\cite{b4}.
    Papers that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press''~\cite{b5}.
    Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and element symbols.

    For papers published in translation journals, please give the English
    citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation~\cite{b6}.
