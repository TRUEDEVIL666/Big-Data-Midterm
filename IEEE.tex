    \begin{abstract}
        In the age of big data, the ability to mine and extract valuable information from massive datasets can give the user an unparalleled edge against the competition.
        Therefore, this requirement made by the lecturer is designed to simulate one of the three most fundamental challenges in data mining.
        Through these series of tasks, we will explore some algorithm implementations and solve different problems as well as explore their trade-offs.
        Each task is a different algorithm to explore and implement with their corresponding datasets.
        Through these tasks, we will gain some practical insight and experience in working with these algorithms as well as a better understanding of their pros and cons to be able to cater to each dataset based on their characteristics.

    \section{Introduction}
    \label{sec:introduction}

    This report is divided into three large sections corresponding to the first three tasks provided by the lecturer.
    We will explore and present our findings while putting the proposed algorithms into practice.

    Task 1 proposes utilizing the A-Priori algorithm in a Hadoop MapReduce program to discover groups of customers shopping on the same date as well as interacting with Hadoop Distributes File System (HDFS) to store files.
    By applying these methods, we will be able to understand how to extract patterns from large datasets locally.

    The second task focuses on implementing the Park-Chen-Yu (PCY) algorithm using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and PySpark DataFrame to identify frequent item pairs and generate association rules from customer purchase data stored in Google Drive.
    The implementation, while generating association rules, also has to follow object-oriented programming principles inspired by PySpark's Frequent-Pattern Growth (FPGrowth) class.

    In the third task, we will implement and compare the MinHashLSH algorithm and an alternative of our choice - in this case, a manual method of calculating Jaccard distance.
    Both of these approaches should achieve the same goal of searching for similar pairs of dates where the Jaccard distance is above a predetermined threshold.
    After that, we will visualize their runtime with their threshold ranging from 0 to 1 with 0.1 increments to gauge their performance and outline some characteristics between both approaches.
    Through these implementations, we demonstrate practical applications of data mining techniques with a given dataset.
    With these findings, we highlight the trade-offs between various aspects across different algorithms within the given time and constraints.

    \section*{Acknowledgment}

    The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without an ``e'' after the ``g''.
    Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. G.) thanks $\ldots$''.
    Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''.
    Put sponsor acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

    \section*{References}

    Please number citations consecutively within brackets~\cite{b1}.
    The sentence punctuation follows the bracket~\cite{b2}.
    Refer simply to the reference number, as in~\cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference~\cite{b3}'' except at the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference~\cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

    Number footnotes separately in superscripts.
    Place the actual footnote at
    the bottom of the column in which it was cited.
    Do not put footnotes in the abstract or reference list.
    Use letters for table footnotes.

    Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use ``et al.''.
    Papers that have not been published, even if they have been submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished''~\cite{b4}.
    Papers that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press''~\cite{b5}.
    Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and element symbols.

    For papers published in translation journals, please give the English
    citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation~\cite{b6}.
